# C++_OpenGL_3D_Graphics
## How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software first, by working with Product Owners and business owners to define goals and requirements for the product. These goals and requirements will help me build an Agile project framework where I use both functional and non-functional requirements as a framework for my design. I will build out initial UML diagrams to get an idea of what components need to interact, how I might encapsulate objects, and what requirements map to classes. Once I have a solid design in place, I will translate these documents into User Stories for Engineers to begin delivering features, beginning with a Minimum Viable Product so we can show value early in the project's life, and to create a fast-feedback loop with stakeholders to ensure project agility. 

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project was delivered in C++ using OpenGL libraries, and was extremely challenging for me. I'm experienced with coding in Python and Ruby, having coded with teams on large products delivering a wide range of features, but this was my first experience rendering 3D graphics with code. I think the biggest skill I learned doing this work is what an OpenGL project could and should look like. I spent a TON of time on this project getting things "working", and my render looking "good", and less time on code structure and efficiency. If I had more time to work on this project, and in future projects, I would modularize my code more, breaking things down further into classes. 

## What design process did you follow for your project work?
This project the design was to iteratively deliver features, first breaking my real life scene down into different deliverables for my final product. I broke things down into delivering the mug shape first, then the handle for the mug. I also delivered the plane that the objects rest on, the cube shape, the book shape and the candle shape in seperate features.  Lastly, lighting, texturizing and camera/controls were all individual features I added in incremental ways, making sure I delivered modular features.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Well this project was nothing but learning for me, so I have a ton of "things I wish I knew before I started an OpenGL project" to carry forward. I think first, looking at the project holistically so I could understand the large chunks of work, breaking those things down into classes and files so my project was structured from the get go. I would also start with all common frameworks before layering in unique features, laying out things like my fragment and vertex shader, my unnamed namespace and my camera, lighting and texture classes. This would help me have a solid foundational basis to layer in additional features like specific shape creations. 

## How do I approach developing programs?
Similar to design, I approaching developing by iterating on features and components. 

## How did iteration factor into your development?
I've spoken a good amount about iteration in my above responses, but it reiterate (lol!) - iteration is how I approached my development process to ensure I delivered modularized code. 

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
It took me a few weeks to start seeing the patterns for coding in OpenGL - but as I added things like texture and light, it became easier and clearer to add new features and then ensure I added them correctly. 

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
This question could easily spawn a a novel, in fact, I'm sure there are several books on this topic! Personally - I love automating process's and building technically sound solutions. I want to be the type of engineer that could slide onto any team and be a quality contributer from the get go, with the end goal of becoming a product subject matter expert wherever I go. Computer Science has core tenant of pursuing technical excellence, which I hope to embody through my work ethic, technical accumen and a mindset of continious improvement. 

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
The biggest takeaway from this graphics class is I've gained a new perspective on how to solve complex coding problems. I feel much more confident being given something I don't have experience in, and "figuring" it out. 

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Similar to the above, being able to solve complex coding problems like we did in this class, gives me new insight into solving future complex problems. I've gained experience in C++, Visual Studio Code, OpenGL libraries and capabilities and 3D graphics rendering.
